In this architecture, data is directly ingested from Apache Pulsar into ClickHouse using the Kafka connector. This setup leverages Pulsar's Kafka compatibility to stream data seamlessly into ClickHouse for storage and analysis.

Here, Apache Pulsar feeds data into Kafka, acting as a buffer and providing additional scalability and fault tolerance. The Kafka connector then streams this data into ClickHouse. This method is beneficial for handling high-volume data streams and adds a layer of resilience to the architecture.

This straightforward approach involves directly inserting data from Apache Pulsar into ClickHouse. It simplifies the data pipeline by eliminating intermediaries, making it suitable for scenarios where immediate data availability in ClickHouse is prioritized.

## Overview

When working with ClickHouse for data storage, I faced the decision of how to insert data: directly into ClickHouse or via an intermediary like Kafka or Pulsar (with Kafka compatibility). This note outlines the considerations for each approach.

## Direct Insertion into ClickHouse

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Direct insertion is straightforward, avoiding the complexity of managing an additional system.
- **Lower Latency**: Data reaches ClickHouse faster without going through an intermediary.
- **Direct Control**: Managing the insertion process directly allows for immediate handling of errors, retries, and custom logic.

### Disadvantages:
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: This method might not handle high variability in data rates or large volumes efficiently.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Without a message broker, implementing a strategy for buffering or retrying during downtime is necessary.
- **Complexity for Producers**: The services sending data to ClickHouse must manage buffering, retry logic, and backpressure themselves.

## Insertion via Kafka or Pulsar

### Advantages:
- **Decoupling**: Separates data producers from consumers, facilitating independent scaling and maintenance.
- **Buffering and Durability**: Acts as a buffer for data, providing durability and helping manage bursty ingestion or temporary outages.
- **Fault Tolerance**: High availability and data replication reduce the risk of loss.
- **Scalability**: Easily scaled by adding more brokers.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple consumers for the same data, enabling complex processing pipelines.

### Disadvantages:
- **Complexity**: Adds complexity to the infrastructure, requiring setup, maintenance, and monitoring.
- **Increased Latency**: Introduces additional latency as data passes through the broker.
- **Operational Overhead**: Running and managing Kafka or Pulsar requires additional effort.

## Conclusion

The choice depends on specific needs. For straightforward applications with low data volume and a need for minimal latency, direct insertion is suitable. For applications requiring robustness, flexibility, and scalability, using a message broker like Kafka or Pulsar is advantageous.
