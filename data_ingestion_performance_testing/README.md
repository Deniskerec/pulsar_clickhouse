## Overview

When working with ClickHouse for data storage, I faced the decision of how to insert data: directly into ClickHouse or via an intermediary like Kafka or Pulsar (with Kafka compatibility). This note outlines the considerations for each approach.

## Direct Insertion into ClickHouse

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Direct insertion is straightforward, avoiding the complexity of managing an additional system.
- **Lower Latency**: Data reaches ClickHouse faster without going through an intermediary.
- **Direct Control**: Managing the insertion process directly allows for immediate handling of errors, retries, and custom logic.

### Disadvantages:
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: This method might not handle high variability in data rates or large volumes efficiently.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Without a message broker, implementing a strategy for buffering or retrying during downtime is necessary.
- **Complexity for Producers**: The services sending data to ClickHouse must manage buffering, retry logic, and backpressure themselves.

## Insertion via Kafka or Pulsar

### Advantages:
- **Decoupling**: Separates data producers from consumers, facilitating independent scaling and maintenance.
- **Buffering and Durability**: Acts as a buffer for data, providing durability and helping manage bursty ingestion or temporary outages.
- **Fault Tolerance**: High availability and data replication reduce the risk of loss.
- **Scalability**: Easily scaled by adding more brokers.
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple consumers for the same data, enabling complex processing pipelines.

### Disadvantages:
- **Complexity**: Adds complexity to the infrastructure, requiring setup, maintenance, and monitoring.
- **Increased Latency**: Introduces additional latency as data passes through the broker.
- **Operational Overhead**: Running and managing Kafka or Pulsar requires additional effort.

## Conclusion

The choice depends on specific needs. For straightforward applications with low data volume and a need for minimal latency, direct insertion is suitable. For applications requiring robustness, flexibility, and scalability, using a message broker like Kafka or Pulsar is advantageous.
