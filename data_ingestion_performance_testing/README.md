Choosing between direct insertion into ClickHouse and inserting via Kafka (or Pulsar with Kafka compatibility) depends on your specific use case, requirements for scalability, reliability, and how you manage your data pipeline. Here are considerations for both approaches:

Direct Insertion into ClickHouse
Advantages:

Simplicity: Directly inserting data into ClickHouse is straightforward and eliminates the complexity of managing an additional message broker like Kafka or Pulsar.
Latency: It can reduce latency since data doesn't need to pass through an intermediary system before reaching ClickHouse.
Control: You have direct control over the insertion process, which can be beneficial for handling errors, retries, or custom logic during data ingestion.
Disadvantages:

Scalability and Flexibility: Direct insertion might not scale as well as using a message broker, especially if you have highly variable data ingestion rates or large volumes of data.
Fault Tolerance: You lose out on the durability and fault tolerance that message brokers offer. If ClickHouse is down or unable to accept writes, you need to implement your own logic to buffer or retry data insertion.
Complexity in Producer Service: The service sending data to ClickHouse needs to handle more complexities around data buffering, retry logic, and backpressure.
Insertion via Kafka (or Pulsar with Kafka compatibility)
Advantages:

Decoupling: Using Kafka as an intermediary decouples data producers from consumers, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance of each component.
Buffering and Durability: Kafka provides durable storage for messages, acting as a buffer. This can be especially useful to handle bursty data ingestion patterns or temporary outages of downstream systems.
Fault Tolerance: Kafka (and Pulsar) offers high availability and fault tolerance. Data is replicated across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of data loss.
Scalability: Kafka is designed to handle high volumes of data and can be scaled out by adding more brokers. Similarly, Pulsar offers excellent scalability features.
Flexibility: You can have multiple consumers for the same data, enabling complex processing pipelines or feeding data into multiple systems from the same source.
Disadvantages:

Complexity: Introducing Kafka adds complexity to your infrastructure, requiring additional setup, maintenance, and monitoring.
Latency: There might be additional latency introduced as data passes through Kafka before reaching ClickHouse.
Operational Overhead: Running Kafka or Pulsar requires managing additional components in your data pipeline, including ensuring their availability and performance.
Conclusion
For simple, low-volume applications or when you need minimal latency between data generation and availability in ClickHouse, direct insertion might be preferable.
For high-volume, distributed applications that require robustness, flexibility, and scalability, using Kafka or Pulsar for ingestion provides significant advantages.
Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific requirements, including data volume, ingestion patterns, operational capabilities, and the architecture of your overall system.
